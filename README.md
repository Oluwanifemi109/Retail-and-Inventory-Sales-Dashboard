## 🎯 Project Overview
This **fully interactive Excel dashboard** was built for **PrimeBeverage Distribution Ltd.**, a major beverage wholesaler, to provide instant clarity on why the business experienced a catastrophic **61% YoY decline** in revenue and profit between 2017–2020.

Instead of static reports, stakeholders now have a **triple-view toggleable dashboard system** that answers critical questions in seconds:

- Sales Drop: Why did sales fall YoY?
- Inventory Efficiency: Which items are overstocked or slow-moving?
- Seasonal Peaks: When does demand surge and how to plan for it?
- Category Profit Mix: Which categories drive revenue or are losing share?



### 🚀 Key Features
- **Three seamless dashboard views** toggled via intuitive buttons  
- Year slicer (2017–2020) that controls **all charts simultaneously**  
- Custom KPI cards with conditional formatting & sparklines
- Deep insights into category performance, profitability, seasonality, and sales channels  
- Dark-mode professional design for presentations & executive reviews

## 🔑 Key Business Insights Uncovered

|-------|--------|----------------|
| 🍺 Beer = 70%+ of business but falling fastest | Explains nearly the entire 61% decline | Urgent investigation into supplier issues, pricing, or consumer shifts |
| 🏆 Corona Extra & Heineken = profit kings | Still generating highest margins despite volume drop | Double down on these SKUs with promotions & loyalty programs |
| ☀️ Clear summer seasonality | May–August = peak demand | Pre-build inventory & run targeted campaigns |
| 📦 Wholesale channel most resilient | 40% share, least volatile | Strengthen wholesale partnerships & incentives |
